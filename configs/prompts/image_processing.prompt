Your task is to extract the mathematical content and texts from the attached handwritten solution images.
Convert all equations, expressions, and symbols into LaTeX format, and wrap each one individually using MathJax display math delimiters: \\[ ... \\].
Return all content, including explanatory text, diagrams (as text description if needed), and derivations.
Ensure all mathematical content and texts are captured in full detail, including steps, derivations, and final results.
Match and format the handwritten solution's math and texts accordingly, without omitting any parts.
